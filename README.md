- Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

  - A query is correctly performed to find the establishments within 0.01 degree of the "Penang Flavours" restaurant
 
      - The query also limits the results to establishments with a RatingValue of 5
      
      - The query uses the sort() method in PyMongo to sort in ascending order on the hygiene score
      
      - The query uses the limit() method in PyMongo to limit the results to 5
      
      - All five results are printed using pprint

- Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.

  - An aggregation pipeline is built to include a match query, group, and sort
      
      - The match query matches documents with a hygiene score of 0

        - The group step of the pipeline is grouped on LocalAuthorityName and counts the number of documents

        - The sort step of the pipeline sorts the count of the documents in descending order

        - The aggregation pipeline is correctly sent to the aggregate() method

        - The results from the aggregation query is cast as a list and then saved to a variable

        - The first ten results are printed using pprint
